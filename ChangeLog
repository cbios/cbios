2005-01-13 Albert Beevendorp
    * moved slot routines to seperate source: slot.asm
      routines are used by both main and sub rom
    * made GETPAT fully functional now in both main and sub rom
    * implemented handler for maskable interrupt to sub rom
      fixes slowdowns with BLTVM

2005-01-11 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
    * Rewrote key buffering code:
      - it uses a ring buffer now (more efficient, more like MSX BIOS)
      - made sure the new buffering code is harmless when interacting with
        a bug in Ashguine 2
      - KILBUF only empties buffer; it does not mess with NEWKEY and OLDKEY
        (this fixes some issues we misdiagnosed as too fast key repeat)

2005-01-10 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
    * Fixed sub ROM version of CLS.
      T&E logo of Ashguine 2 is now shown on a black background.

      docs, the verify feature is optional, so we just ignore the verify flag.

2005-01-08 Albert Beevendorp
