C-BIOS machine configurations for openMSX
=========================================

Note: these configurations will only work in openMSX 0.5.0 or later.

Installation instructions:
1. Copy "C-BIOS_MSX1" and "C-BIOS_MSX2" subdirectories to "share/machines" in
   the openMSX installation directory or the openMSX user directory.
2. Copy "cbios_main.rom" and "cbios_sub.rom" to the openMSX ROM pool
   ("share/systemroms") or copy them into the "roms" directories of
   "C-BIOS_MSX1" and "C-BIOS_MSX2" (MSX1 doesn't need the sub rom).
