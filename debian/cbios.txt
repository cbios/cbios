! DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents briefly the C-BIOS rom files.

This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.

C-BIOS is an open source BIOS for MSX computers. C-BIOS can be shipped with MSX emulators so they are usable out-of-the-box.

Details about the BIOS calls available in the ROM files can be found at http://map.tni.nl/ but keep in mind the C-BIOS is work in progress and does not support all BIOS calls yet.

C-BIOS comes in three versions currently. C-BIOS_MSX1 is compatible with MSX1 machines, C-BIOS_MSX2 is compatible with MSX2 machines and C-BIOS_MSX2+ is compatible with MSX2+ machines.
