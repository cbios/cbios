Building C-BIOS From Source
===========================

First, get a Z80 assembler. The following assemblers can build C-BIOS without
requiring modifications to the source code:
  * Pasmo   -  http://www.arrakis.es/~ninsesabe/pasmo/
  * SjASM   -  http://www.xl2s.tk/
  * tniASM  -  http://www.tni.nl/products/tniasm.html
All three of them work on Windows, Pasmo and SjASM work on Linux too and
probably on other Unix-like systems as well.

Building with Pasmo:
On Unix-like systems: Run "make". You should have GNU Make or something similar
enough installed on your machine.
On Windows: Run "make.bat" like this: "make pasmo".

Building with SjASM:
Define Z80_ASSEMBLER=sjasm in your environment, or edit the assembler selection
at the very top of the Makefile. Then run "make".
You should have GNU Make or something similar enough installed on your machine.
Or if you use Windows and do not want to install Make, you can adapt "make.bat"
manually.

Building with tniASM:
Run "make.bat".
If you use tniASM prior to version 0.43, please upgrade or replace "!=" by "<>"
in the conditional assembly statements.

The produced ROM files are located in the directory "derived/bin", which will
be automatically created. You can find symbol listings in "derived/lst", they
are useful for debugging.

To test C-BIOS, you can use the supplied emulator configurations in the
"configs" directory.

If you have made interesting improvements to C-BIOS, please tell us about them.
